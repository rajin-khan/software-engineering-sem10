    * 2: Design
       * Ensure flexibility to accommodate requirement changes.
       * Plan architecture and software flow.
   
    * 3: Implementation (Coding)
       * Convert human language into code.
       * Skill improves with experience and projects.
   
    * 4: Testing
       * Identify and fix bugs.
       * Adopt an attitude of problem-solving ("I can make it happen").
   
    * 5: Reiterate the Process
        * Improve and refine based on feedback.
   
    * 6: Release
