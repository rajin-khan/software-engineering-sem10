Design patterns, continued:

Singleton Pattern:

Useful in ORMs.
There will be a class of which only ONE object can be created. The specific behaviour is:

```java
Class Singleton 
{

    Singleton a = new Singleton();
    Singleton b = new Singleton(); //this should not be possible. The behaviour that we want is, creating the object b should point the object created when a was instantiated.
}
```

Adv:
Devs don't need to check if an object was already created/created in the past.

How might we execute this?

```java
Class Singleton 
{
    static Singleton session = null;

    private Singleton() 
    {
        ...
    }

    static public Singleton getSingleton()
    {
        if (!session)
        {
            session = new Singleton();
        }
        return session;
    }
}

from the outside,

a = Singleton.getSingleton();
b = Singleton.getSingleton(); //will point to the same one
```

# problem for ORM:

```java
Student s = new Student("000");
...
Student p = new Student("000");
```
we have to ensure that for one student, there is only one object created.
there can be multiple student objects, but not for the same student.

how would we implement this?

```java
Class Student 
{
    private static HashMap<String, Student> hash = new HashMap<String, Student>();

    private Student() 
    {
        ...
    }

    public static Student getStudent(String id)
    {
        if (!hash.exists(id))
        {
            hash.put(new Student(id));
        }
        return hash.get(id);
    }
}
```

look up hash maps

look up decorator pattern.
