Design patterns, continued

### 1: Factory Method (literally a method, like functions): Used to create objects from parameters passed into the method of a class.

A very common way of using a factory method is to create a hash value for a created object to make it unique. thus, we encapsulate the logic of creating objects, not the creation of the object itself.

### Abstract factory: (vv useful)

say we want to create a car assembler:

```java
class CarAssembler
{
    Chassis ch;
    Engine e;
    GearBox g;

    Tyre t[4];
    FrontSeat fs[2];
    Backseat bs;
    Body b;
    Logo l;

    public CarAssembler (Chassis ch, Engine e, GearBox g, Tyre t[4], FrontSeat fs[2], Backseat bs, Body b, Logo l) {

        this.ch = pc;
        ...
    }
    public Car assemble() //creates a car
    {

        ...
    }
}
```

so now, we expect:

**insert 9325a here**

```java
CarAssembler assember = new CarAssembler(new ToyotaChassis, new ToyotaEngine, ...)
```

but it allows us to do this:

```java
CarAssembler assember = new CarAssembler(new ToyotaChassis, new WaltonEngine, ...)
```

this allows us to make mistakes.
we want to avoid that.

We want to create a design that does not need the Developer to dig into the documentation.

So, to avoid these mistakes, we create a PartsFactory.

**insert 9325b here**

So now, our code looks like this:

```java
class CarAssembler
{
    PartsFactory pf;

    public CarAssembler (PublicFactory pf) 
    {

        this.factory = pf;
    }
    
    public Car assemble() //creates a car
    {

        Body b = this.factory.getBody(); //now the factory retrieves the correct parts
        Logo l = this.factiry.getLogo();
        ...
    }
}
```

so there is no room for error.

*do the magical and nonmagical characters now with AbstractFactory concept*

### 2: Composite Pattern: Represents a tree.

Say, for example, we resize shapes in a design editor. we can also group them and resize altogether. what we want is a way to resize them all in a simple way. no matter if it's a shape, or a bunch of shapes together (composite shapes), i will just call the .resize method.

**9325c**

This means that we have to only write special logic for the CompositeShape class. whereas if we apply resize on CompositeShape, it will apply .resize for everything in it (whether it be shapes or another CompositeShape).

```java
class CompositeShape 
{

    public ArrayList<Shape> list;

    public void addToComposite (Shape s)
    {
        list.append(s);
    }

    public void resize(float factor) //so now resize is called for every element/shape in CompositeShape
    {
        for each s in list {
            s.resize(factor);
        }
    }
}
```

*in your game design uml, the container is an example of CompositePattern*

*look up Singleton before next class*
