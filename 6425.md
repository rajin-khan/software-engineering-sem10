MVC (Model View Controller)

is a separation mechanism (one of the reasons you'd want to separate due to singular responsibility)

it says that if you have a use case that involves a:

UI (doesn't have to be just users, can be api calls too) [view]

Business logic [controller/view], and (something that's not a getter and setter, slightly more complex, like search, etc)
[set cgpa is not a business logic. change student address is a business logic]

let's take the example of change student address. for this, we'll need to know who's changing the address, the student's id, and the new address.
business logic can be called by multiple devices/users

Data [model, object representation of our data]
the thought is, if we can create an easily accessible API version of our data, it's better than simple sql queries.

actors: human, api, etc

so we have good separation of concerns.
in an mvc system, we are deploying all my model, view, controller data as a package in a remote container.
so when our product is popular, we may need to add multiple containers and add load balancers in front of it. (CQRS)

next: 

CQRS (made for slightly more complex needs) [Command query response segregation]

command: business logic that will change/update your underlying data (potentially a change to data if that business logic is improved)
query: business logic that simply reads data but does not transform it. (NOT LOGS. LOGS ARE SYSTEM DATA)

here, we'll essentially take our codebase and replicate it across different machines. but, all containers are now trying to access a single database.
so, reads and writes may be blocked by other containers trying to log on the same row (maybe).
(learn about locking/logging in databases)

in most systems, i will have more queries than commands. only a fraction of them are usually commands. there's not much editing involved.

so, think of it like two different projects:
one will contain the code for all the queries
one will contain the code for all the commands
and they will both potentially access the data layer.

so, we can have machines that will run command only code
and machines that will process query only code.

commands can potentially change data, so we'll have authoritative data stores connected to the data source.
we can change our queries based on other databases
so, every time, there's a change ehre, we can set up sync across all read databases, and the authoritative write databases.

strong consistency: data updated, reflected to all users immediately
sequential consistency: data updated, reflected one by one
eventual consistency: data updated, will eventually be accessible, not at the same time

(look into publisher-subscriber method, very similar to observer pattern, with slight extensions)

final questions: (40 minutes)

1a (2 marks) case study given, identify what patterns may be used to solve this use case, (JUST GIVE THE NAMES OF THE DESIGN PATTERNS, do not DO NOT justify them)
1b (8 marks) in the patterns named in 1a, use the patterns described to create a uml diagram using those design patterns

2a (2 marks) same as 1a
2b (8 marks) same as 1b

if 1a has a mistake, 1b is not marked. things to note: able to choose the right design problem fit for certain problem patterns. this is the main thing to note. practice all the given patterns.
